# Hands On Lab #4 - Avoiding Common Order Submission Issues

CSP partners commonly run into issues when placing orders due to validation checks that occur in the commerce system. Many of these issues can be addressed prior to submitting an order by the partner. In this lab you will learn about some of these techniques.

> You can find a completed version of the solution that you would have at the conclusion of the lab in the [completed](completed) folder. Any settings, such as IDs, passwords, keys and other partner-specific values have been removed from the completed solution, but if you run into trouble you can use the final solution as a template to compare your work against if you have trouble.
